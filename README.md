VH1 News Instagram Template Generator

This is a tool that you can use to make VH1 Instagram Images.

What it does:

1. Crop your image to a square and resize to 1080x1080
2. Apply Graphic Overlay
3. Apply Text to Graphic Overlay.


Most of this is done client side with Canvas. However, text with it still sucks so I used Imagemagick to take care of that.

All JS is compiled and in site.min.js.
